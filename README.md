# Spacepong 

**Spacepong** is a 2D arcade game inspired by the classic Pong. In this game, players control paddles to deflect a meteor ball and prevent it from crossing their defense line. Each time the meteor successfully passes through the opponentâ€™s defense, the player scores a point. The match continues until one of the players reaches a certain score, and that player is declared the winner.
